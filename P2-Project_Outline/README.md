## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This app will provide foster parents a way to record behaviors and interventions, as well as other monthly activities, like fire drills, for required monthly reporting. Currently, foster parents complete this record on paper and turn it into their social worker who then compiles the data for a monthly report. This app can increase accuracy and efficiency for recording the data and aid communication between foster parents and social workers. Other potential capabilities include monthly reminders, like for fire drills, and sending a message to the social worker to call attention to particular event/record.

A social worker for a foster agency discussed the challenges of gathering required monthly reporting data. Foster parents expressed a desire for a more convenient way to submit their records, however due to HIPAA regulations, they cannot simply email the records to their social worker.  

### Features

User login: Users will create a secure account to login to the application. User can only see their profile and entries. Administrator can see users' profiles and entries.
Create Post: Users will be able to create new behavior and interventions records/posts when logged in. New posts available in the user's profile. Organize records by month.
Calendar/Reminders: Have a calendar available on the app with reminders to submit reports and conduct monthly activities.
Front-end: The app is visually appealing and doesn't look like users are filling out an excel spreadsheet. 

Optional:
Send message feature: If users are completing records regularly and would like to draw immediate attention to their case workers to a particular entry, perhaps there could be a radio button ("please call" or "schedule meeting") to send a message/email for the user. 
Search/List/Organize: possibly organize behaviors in a way to identify patterns?
